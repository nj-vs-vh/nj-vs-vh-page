just a tiny expense tracker. stores a log of transactions and computes some
primitive statistics on the total balance change and earnings/spendings. i would
really like to just keep my expenses in a spreadsheet, but it's impractical to edit
on the go. notable feature, outside of the basics, is automatic currency conversion
and weekly reporting.

plans include making a (accordingly tiny) frontend for this thing to view plots/analytics.
