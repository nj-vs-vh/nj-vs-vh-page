i would like to build a sundial, specifically
a [reclining sundial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial#Reclining_dials), to
put in my yard. i haven't found a suitable template generator online, so i made a simple
script that generates it. it calculates the Sun position in the sky (with
[suncalc](https://github.com/kylebarron/suncalc-py)) and projects the gnomon on the plane given
its orientation w.r.t. Earth.

here's the schematic for the sundial i plan to put on my garden wall:
