i like inventing bicycles so for my little personal project collection page I'm writing
a custom Static Site Generator in Rust. it doesn't really do anything cool yet but I like
the idea of having a fully customizable thing.

greatly inspired by [fasterthanlime blog](https://fasterthanli.me/)

## features
- project descriptions are written in markdown with some custom extensions
- code blocks with highlighting (with [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/))
- per-project media files
