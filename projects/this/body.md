i like inventing bicycles so this website is based on a custom Static Site
Generator written in Rust. it doesn't really do anything cool yet but I like

greatly inspired by [fasterthanlime blog](https://fasterthanli.me/) (in the sense
of making a custom thing to post your stuff online)

## cool features:
