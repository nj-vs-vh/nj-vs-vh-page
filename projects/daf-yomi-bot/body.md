[Daf Yomi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daf_Yomi) is a Jewish practice of learning a page of
[Talmud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud#Babylonian_and_Jerusalem) every day and a regimen
assigning every page for a given date in a 7.5 year long cycle. for a long time i wanted to
participate in Daf Yomi to better familiarize myself with rabbinical tradition. however, the
reading of Talmud is challenging, so for me to keep this up, the friction must be absolutely
minimal. so i made a tiny telegram bot that formats the data from
[Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Talmud) in the form of a telegram channel post. i guess
the time will tell if it's effective enough!
