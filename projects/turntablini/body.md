for a while now i've been dreaming about a way to listen to music with care and attention to detail,
but collectively. i know that dedicated events exist for that, but i've never been to one. finally,
i got around to organize something in this vein for my friends, and i decided to cross it over with
blini party, a kind of brunch centered around eating [blini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blini) with
various garnishes and fillings. i got so excited about the idea that i even made a funny little promo/intro
video for it:
